# CSRtm

Mine the texts in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports, and generate specific text-based features specified in prior literature.

Text-based features that we are interested in mining are:

1. length (Miller, 2010)
2. readability or Fog-index  (Loughran and McDonald, 2014)
3. boilerplate (Lang and Stice-Lawrence, 2015)
4. redundancy (Cazier and Pfeiffer, 2015)
5. specificity (Hope et al., 2016)
6. stickiness (Brown and Tucker, 2011)
7. relative prevalence of informative numbers in the text or “hard” information (Blankespoor, 2016)
